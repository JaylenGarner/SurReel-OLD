## Overview

SurReel is an Instagram clone. When a user first accesses the site, they are brought to the login page. On the login page, they are also presented with the option to navigate to the sign up page. Attempting to access any page on the site without login/signup will redirect them to login.

When logging into the site, the user is greeted with their feed. The feed will contain the posts of other users that the current user follows. If the user is not following anyone, they are presented with the following message and a button that navigates them to a page that displays all of the application's users: "There are no posts in your feed, get started by following other users"
